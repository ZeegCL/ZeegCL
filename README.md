My name is JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez and I'm a data engineer from Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. In the past I did a lot of development and worked as sysadmin, so I've spent a lot of time between code, servers and databases. I'm a perpetual student, a fast learner, and a really curious person. I tend to focus a lot on customer experience and business processes, and I obtained a diploma on Digital Transformation tools in the past.

Coming from a dev/sysadmin background, I decided to focus on solving problems around data, specially data infrastructure and pipelines, which I think is one of the major pain points in companies nowadays.

Here's a summary of skills areas you might be interested in:

**Programming languages**

- **Python (1 year):** this is currently my main programming language. I do a lot of stuff with it, from data scrapping and wrangling to web development.
- **SQL (8 years):** when working with databases, I've done from ad-hoc queries with subqueries and CTEs, to scripting stored procedures for advanced processing of data.
- **PHP (~3 years):** started with vanilla code on PHP 5.2, then spent some time with CodeIgniter, and finally moved to Laravel (v5.4 and up).
- **Javascript (~6 years):** started doing fun stuff with just plain JS in the browser, and then developed some chat bots with NodeJs. Nowadays I'm into React and NodeJS.
- **C# + .Net (5 years):** transitioning from .Net Framework 4.0 to .Net Core 2.0. Mainly maintaining a web system for the company I worked in.
- **Others:** did some Minecraft server plugins and some native Android apps with Java. Also helped a bit on the [Azerothcore project](https://github.com/azerothcore/) using C++.

**Databases**

- **MS SQL Server (8 years):** this has been the main DBMS I've faced on production systems. Managed the data, security and performance of the database server.
- **MySQL (8 years):** used it on freelance projects and small websites, due to it's popularity and support.
- **Postgres (1 year):** used it mainly on Apache Airflow implementations.

**Server OS**
- **Ubuntu Server (8 years)**: managed a lot of services, including: Apache web server (HTTPD), databases, FTP, SSH, firewall, Postfix and LDAP.
- **Windows Server (8 years)**: managed the network with Active Directory, a web server with IIS and databases with MS SQL Server.
