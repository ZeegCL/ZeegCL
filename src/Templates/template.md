### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JosÃ© (a.k.a. Zeeg)

I'm a software engineer from Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± focused on fullstack web development. In the past I've worked with:
- **PHP (~8 years):** started with the good ol' Vanilla, then spent some time with CodeIgniter, and finally moved to Laravel (v5.4 and up).
- **Javascript (~6 years):** started doing fun stuff with just plain JS in the browser, and then developed some chat bots with Nodejs. Nowadays I'm into React and AdonisJS.
- **C# + .Net (5 years):** transitioning from .Net Framework 4.0 to .Net Core 2.0. Mainly maintaining a web system for the company I worked in.
- **Others:** did some Minecraft server plugins and some native Android apps with Java, helped a bit on the [Azerothcore project](https://github.com/azerothcore/) using C++, and learned a bit about data processing and analysis with Python.

I'm a perpetual student, a fast learner, and a really curious person. I tend to focus a lot on customer experience, so I'll be reading a lot about UX design, digital transformation, and the like. You know... the experience given by your software must be good if you want to sell something.

Currently working as the interim Director of IT for a local educational institution âœ¨.
